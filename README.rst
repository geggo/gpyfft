gpyfft
======

A Python wrapper for the OpenCL FFT library APPML/clAmdFft from AMD

Introduction
------------

AMD has created a nice FFT library for use with their OpenCL
implementation called `AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing Math
Libraries
<http://developer.amd.com/libraries/appmathlibs/Pages/default.aspx>`_
This C library is available as precompiled binaries for Windows and
Linux platforms. It is optimized for AMD GPUs. (Note: This library is
not limited to work only with hardware from AMD, but according to this
`forum entry <http://devgurus.amd.com/thread/159149>`_ it currently
yields wrong results on NVidia GPUs.)

This python wrapper is designed to tightly integrate with pyopencl. It
consists of a low-level cython based wrapper with an interface similar
to the underlying C library. On top of that it offers a high-level
interface designed to work on data contained in instances of
pyopencl.array.Array, a numpy work-alike array class. The high-level
interface is similar to that of `pyFFTW
<https://github.com/hgomersal/pyFFTW>`_, a python wrapper for the FFTW
library.

Compared to `pyfft <http://github.com/Manticore/pyfft>`_, a python
implementation of Apple's FFT library, AMD's FFT library offers some
additional features such as transform sizes that are powers of 2,3 and
5, and real-to-complex transforms. And on AMD hardware a better
performance can be expected, e.g., gpyfft: 280 Gflops compared to
pyfft: 63 GFlops (for single precision, accurate math,
inplace, transform size 1024x1024, batch size 4, on AMD Cayman, HD6950).


Status
------

This wrapper is currently under development.

work done
~~~~~~~~~

-  low level wrapper (mostly) completed
-  high level wrapper: complex (single precision), interleaved data, in
   and out of place (some tests and benchmarking available)
-  creation of pyopencl Events for synchronization

missing features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  debug mode to output generated kernels
-  documentation for low level wrapper (instead refer to library doc)
-  define API for high level interface
-  high level interface: double precision data, planar data,
   real<->complex transforms
-  high level interface: tests for non-contiguous data
-  handling of batched transforms in the general case, e.g. shape
   (4,5,6), axes = (1,), i.e., more than one axes where no transform is
   performed. (not always possible with single call for arbitrary
   strides, need to figure out when possible)

Requirements
------------

-  python
-  pyopencl (git version newer than 4 Jun 2012)
-  cython
-  APPML clAmdFft 1.8
-  AMD APP SDK

Installation
------------

1) Install the AMD library:

   - install clAmdFft
   - add clAmdFft/binXX to PATH, or copy clAmdFft.Runtime.dll to
     package directory
   - edit setup.py to point to clAmdFft and AMD APP directories

Then, either:

2) python setup.py install

Or:

3) inplace build: python setup.py build\_ext --inplace
